## A

### Agent
**Definition:** An autonomous software program that uses AI models to make decisions and perform tasks.

**In Agentflare:** Agents connect through the Agentflare proxy to access MCP servers and other tools while providing full observability of their decision-making process.

**See also:** MCP, [Tool Calls](/content/tool-calls)

### Analytics
**Definition:** The systematic analysis of data to discover meaningful patterns and insights.

**In Agentflare:** Performance analytics track agent behavior, resource usage, and decision patterns across all tool calls and interactions.

**See also:** [Performance Analytics](/content/performance-analytics), [Cost Tracking](/content/cost-tracking)

---

## C

### Cost Attribution
**Definition:** The process of assigning costs to specific operations, users, or resources.

**In Agentflare:** Cost attribution tracks token usage, API calls, and resource consumption down to individual agent actions, enabling precise cost analysis and optimization.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "tool_call": "database_query",
  "tokens_used": 1250,
  "estimated_cost": "$0.025"
}
```

**See also:** [Cost Tracking](#cost-tracking), [Performance Analytics](#performance-analytics)

### Cost Tracking
**Definition:** Monitoring and recording expenses associated with AI agent operations.

**Usage:** Enables teams to understand and optimize the financial impact of their AI deployments by tracking costs per tool call, session, or user.

**See also:** [Cost Attribution](#cost-attribution), [Token Usage](#token-usage)

---

## D

### Decision Reasoning
**Definition:** The logical process and context that leads an AI agent to make a specific choice or action.

**In Agentflare:** Captured through thought tracing, decision reasoning provides transparency into why agents make specific tool calls or responses.

**See also:** [Thought Tracing](#thought-tracing), [Memory Replay](#memory-replay)

---

## E

### Early Access
**Definition:** A program allowing selected users to test and provide feedback on features before general availability.

**In Agentflare:** The early access program provides priority access to new Telepathy features and direct support from the Agentflare team.

---

## M

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
**Definition:** A standardized protocol for communication between AI agents and external tools or services.

**In Agentflare:** MCP servers act as the integration layer between your AI agents and various tools, with the Agentflare proxy sitting between them to capture observability data.

**Example:**
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "database_query",
    "arguments": {"query": "SELECT * FROM users"}
  }
}
```

**See also:** [MCP Proxy](#mcp-proxy), [MCP Server](#mcp-server), [Tool Calls](#tool-calls)

### MCP Proxy
**Definition:** An intermediary service that sits between AI agents and MCP servers to intercept and analyze communication.

**In Agentflare:** The MCP proxy captures all interactions between agents and servers, providing observability without modifying your existing MCP implementation.

**See also:** [MCP](#mcp), [Proxy](#proxy)

### MCP Server
**Definition:** A service that implements the Model Context Protocol to provide tools and capabilities to AI agents.

**Usage:** MCP servers expose functions like database queries, API calls, or file operations that agents can use to complete tasks.

**Example:**
```typescript
const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "database-tools",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: [/* tool definitions */]
});
```

**See also:** MCP, [Tool Calls](/content/tool-calls)

### Memory Replay
**Definition:** The ability to reconstruct and analyze an AI agent's state and context at any point in its execution history.

**In Agentflare:** Memory replay helps debug agent behavior by showing exactly what information the agent had access to when making specific decisions.

**See also:** [Thought Tracing](#thought-tracing), [Decision Reasoning](#decision-reasoning)

### Migration Guide
**Definition:** Documentation that provides step-by-step instructions for transitioning from one system or version to another.

**In Agentflare:** The migration guide assists teams in adopting Agentflare Telepathy with minimal disruption to existing workflows.

## O

### Observability
**Definition:** The ability to understand the internal state of a system based on its external outputs.

**In Agentflare:** Telepathy provides comprehensive observability for AI agents, including thought processes, tool usage, performance metrics, and cost data.

**See also:** [Telepathy](#telepathy), [Thought Tracing](#thought-tracing)

### OpenTelemetry (OTEL)
**Definition:** An open-source framework for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data.

**In Agentflare:** OTEL exporters allow integration with existing observability stacks like Datadog, Grafana, or Jaeger.

**Example:**
```yaml
exporters:
  - type: otlp
    endpoint: "https://your-collector.example.com:4317"
```

**See also:** [Observability](#observability), [Telemetry](#telemetry)

---

## P

### Performance Analytics
**Definition:** The measurement and analysis of system efficiency, speed, and resource utilization.

**In Agentflare:** Tracks latency, throughput, error rates, and resource consumption for each agent interaction and tool call.

**Key Metrics:**
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Token usage per operation
- Tool call success rates
- Concurrent session capacity

**See also:** [Analytics](#analytics), [Cost Tracking](#cost-tracking)

### Proxy
**Definition:** An intermediary server that forwards requests between clients and servers.

**In Agentflare:** The Agentflare proxy intercepts agent-to-server communication to provide observability without modifying your application code.

**See also:** [MCP Proxy](#mcp-proxy)

## T

### Telepathy
**Definition:** Agentflare's observability platform that provides insight into AI agent thought processes and decision-making.

**Core Features:**
- Thought tracing for decision transparency

### Thought Tracing
**Definition:** The capture and visualization of an AI agent's reasoning process during task execution.

**In Agentflare:** Thought tracing reveals the chain of reasoning that leads to each tool call or decision, making agent behavior interpretable and debuggable.

```
1. User requested database information
2. Evaluating available tools: database_query, file_read
3. Selected database_query based on SQL context
4. Formulating query parameters...
```

### Token Usage
**Definition:** The consumption of computational units (tokens) by language models during processing.

**In Agentflare:** Token usage is tracked per operation to enable accurate cost attribution and optimization opportunities.

### Tool Calls
**Definition:** Invocations of external functions or services by an AI agent to complete tasks.

**In Agentflare:** Every tool call is captured with full context, including parameters, results, timing, and associated costs.

## W

### WebSocket
**Definition:** A communication protocol providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

**In Agentflare:** WebSocket connections enable real-time streaming of agent thoughts and tool calls to the Telepathy dashboard.

**Protocol Example:**
```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.agentflare.com/v1/stream');
ws.on('message', (data) => {
  const event = JSON.parse(data);
  // Handle real-time agent events
});
```

**See also:** [WebSocket Events](#websocket-events), [WebSocket Protocol](#websocket-protocol)

### WebSocket Events
**Definition:** Real-time messages transmitted over WebSocket connections to notify clients of state changes or new data.
