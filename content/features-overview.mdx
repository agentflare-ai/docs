## What is Agentflare?

Agentflare provides protocol-level observability for AI agent tool servers, giving you complete transparency and control over your AI systems. Track every decision, measure tool selection performance, and validate compliance in real-time.

- **Why did my agent make that decision?**
- **What was the agent thinking at each step?**
- **How much is each decision costing me?**
- **Where are the performance bottlenecks?**

## Core Architecture

Agentflare operates on two foundational components:

### 1. Multi-Tenant Proxy
A hosted proxy service that sits between your AI agents and tool servers, providing:
- **Zero-configuration observability** - Add your tool server and get a proxy URL
- **Custom domain support** - Use your own domain (e.g., `mcp.yourcompany.com`)
- **Real-time tool reasoning capture** - See why agents select specific tools
- **Automatic tracking** - Captures reasoning, confidence, latency, and cost per decision

### 2. Agentflare Dashboard
A comprehensive web interface for visualizing agent behavior:
- **Live tool call feed** - Real-time stream of all agent actions
- **Tool reasoning** - See why agents selected specific tools
- **Agent reasoning** - Step-by-step decision visualization
- **Schema Studio** - Fine-tune decision pathways without redeploying code
- **Performance analytics** - Identify bottlenecks and optimize
- **Cost breakdown** - Detailed cost analysis per tool, session, and model

## How It Works

### Simple Proxy Integration
Getting started with Agentflare is straightforward:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Your Tool Server">
    Add your MCP tool server to Agentflare via the dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get Proxy URL">
    Receive a unique proxy URL for your tool server
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update Your Agent">
    Point your AI agent to use the Agentflare proxy URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Observing">
    Instantly see tool calls, reasoning, and performance in real-time
  </Step>
</Steps>

```bash
# Example: Point your client to the Agentflare proxy
export MCP_SERVER_URL="https://<server-slug>.proxy.agentflare.com"
```

### OTEL Export
