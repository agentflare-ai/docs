## What is Telepathy?

Telepathy is Agentflare's flagship observability service that provides unprecedented visibility into AI agent decision-making processes. It's designed to answer the fundamental questions every AI developer faces:

- **Why did my agent make that decision?**
- **What was the agent thinking at each step?**
- **How much is each decision costing me?**
- **Where are the performance bottlenecks?**

## Core Architecture

{/* Telepathy Architecture diagram will be added when available */}

Telepathy operates on three foundational pillars:

### 1. Multi-Tenant Proxy
A hosted proxy service that sits between your AI agents and MCP servers, providing:
- **Zero-configuration observability** - No code changes required
- **Custom domain support** - Use your own domain (e.g., `mcp.yourcompany.com`)
- **Automatic model detection** - Identifies AI models via self-identification
- **Real-time cost tracking** - Tracks API costs per call, session, and model

### 2. Enhanced SDK Integration
Drop-in replacement SDKs that instrument your existing code:
- **Automatic span generation** - Every tool call becomes a traceable span
- **Reasoning capture** - Records the "why" behind each decision
- **Performance metrics** - Latency, throughput, and resource usage
- **Confidence scoring** - Tracks decision confidence and alternatives

### 3. Telepathy Dashboard
A comprehensive web interface for visualizing agent behavior:
- **Live tool call feed** - Real-time stream of all agent actions
- **Thought tracing** - Step-by-step decision visualization
- **Performance analytics** - Identify bottlenecks and optimize
- **Cost breakdown** - Detailed cost analysis per tool, session, and model

## Integration Options

### 1. Proxy Integration (Recommended)
The easiest way to get started - no code changes required:

```bash
# Point your MCP client to our proxy
export MCP_SERVER_URL="https://<your-workspace>.agentflare.com/proxy"
```

### 2. SDK Integration
For maximum observability, use our enhanced SDKs:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { TelepathyClient } from '@agentflare/telepathy-sdk';

const client = new TelepathyClient({
  apiKey: process.env.API_JWT_SECRET,
  projectId: process.env.AGENTFLARE_PROJECT_ID
});
```

```python Python
from agentflare_telepathy import TelepathyClient

client = TelepathyClient(
    api_key=os.getenv("API_JWT_SECRET"),
    project_id=os.getenv("AGENTFLARE_PROJECT_ID")
)
```
</CodeGroup>

### 3. OTEL Export
Send data to your existing observability stack:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Jaeger">
    ```yaml
    exporters:
      jaeger:
        endpoint: http://localhost:14268/api/traces
        headers:
          x-api-key: <your-jaeger-key>
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Datadog">
    ```yaml
    exporters:
      datadog:
        api_key: ${DD_API_KEY}
        site: datadoghq.com
        service: telepathy-agent
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="New Relic">
    ```yaml
    exporters:
      newrelic:
