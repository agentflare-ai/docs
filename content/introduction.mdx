## What is Telepathy?

Telepathy is the first comprehensive observability service for MCP-based AI agents that captures decision reasoning, performance metrics, and cost attribution. It's designed to give developers and MCP server owners complete visibility into their agent's thought processes.

## Why Telepathy?

### The Problem vs. Solution

| Without Telepathy | With Telepathy |
|-------------------|----------------|
| ðŸš« **Opaque Decisions** - Why did the agent choose this tool? | âœ… **Complete Reasoning** - See exactly why each decision was made |
| ðŸš« **Unknown Costs** - How much is this costing me? | âœ… **Real-time Cost Tracking** - Track costs per tool, session, and model |
| ðŸš« **Performance Blindness** - Where are the bottlenecks? | âœ… **Performance Analytics** - Identify bottlenecks and optimize |
| ðŸš« **Debugging Nightmare** - Agent failed, but why? | âœ… **Rich Error Context** - Detailed error information and context |
| ðŸš« **Manual Instrumentation** - Complex observability setup | âœ… **One-Line Integration** - Change one import line, get instant observability |

### The Solution

Telepathy provides complete visibility into your agent's decision-making process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Drop-in Integration">
    Change one import line in your code - that's it
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Instrumentation">
    Every tool call is captured with reasoning, timing, and cost
  </Step>
  <Step title="Real-time Visualization">
    See your agent's thoughts in real-time through our dashboard
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export Anywhere">
    Send data to your existing observability stack via OTEL
  </Step>
</Steps>
